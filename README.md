# Google Books

## Description
Keeping track of books you've read or have been wanting to read can prove to be quite the task. However, this Google Books app makes it easier than ever to find new books to read or save the one's you've already read.

On the homepage of the app, the user will see a "Book Search" and once the user enters a book, below it the search reults will appear. In the search results, the user can choose to "View" the book which will redirect them to the Google Books page for that selected title. Otherwise, the user can choose to "Save" the book and it will then populate in the "Saved" page of the app.
